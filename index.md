## About Me üîç

üëãüèæ Hello there! My name is Anirban, but I go by my nickname Vivek. Professionally, I'm broadly interested in machine learning modeling and infrastructure, cloud/cluster computing, and ethical AI. 

I currently work as a Software Development Engineer at [Amazon Search](https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/search-and-information-retrieval), where I help develop Deep Learning ranking model training and hosting architecture focused on improving customer shopping experiences and search recommendations through optimizing inference efficiency and experimentation velocity. I graduated with a Master's degree in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu) from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://grainger.illinois.edu/) (UIUC). Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree from [UC Berkeley](https://ls.berkeley.edu/home), where I double majored in [Computer Science](https://eecs.berkeley.edu) and [Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/).

Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, meeting people, and attempting to stay updated on current events and general knowledge. Actively, I like strength training, playing and watching sports, and working on various hobbies. Passively, I can be found [picking up more books than I can finish](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120875328-vivek-datta), [pretending to be Roger Ebert](https://letterboxd.com/viv360/), or [curating Spotify playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/128513931?si=19799f6397bd4f80). 

If you have an interest in anything I've mentioned above, please feel free to reach out!

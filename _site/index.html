<h2 id="about-me-">About Me 🔍</h2>

<p>👋🏾 Hello there! My name is Anirban, but I go by Vivek (my nickname). Professionally, I’m broadly interested in machine learning modeling and infrastructure, cloud/cluster computing, and responsible/ethical AI.</p>

<p>I currently work as a Software Development Engineer at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/research-areas/search-and-information-retrieval">Amazon Search</a>, where I help develop Deep Learning ranking model training and hosting architecture focused on improving customer shopping experiences and search recommendations through optimizing inference efficiency and experimentation velocity. I graduated with a Master’s degree in <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu">Computer Science</a> from the <a href="https://grainger.illinois.edu/">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a> (UIUC). Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s degree from <a href="https://ls.berkeley.edu/home">UC Berkeley</a>, where I double majored in <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/">Data Science</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy traveling, meeting people, and attempting to stay updated on current events and general knowledge. Actively, I like strength training, playing basketball, supporting Bay Area sports teams, and working on music. Passively, I can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/120875328-vivek-datta">picking up more books than I can finish</a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/viv360/">pretending to be Roger Ebert</a>, or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/128513931?si=19799f6397bd4f80">curating Spotify playlists</a>.</p>

<p>If you have an interest in anything I’ve mentioned above, please feel free to reach out!</p>
